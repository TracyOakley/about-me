#### Reflections and Comments  
1) Some good Lesson Learned. I was invoking toLowerCase on my prompt but I left off the () so it wasn't working. I guess it is a good practice to verify in smaller steps.
2) Another one, I want to make a function but I dont know understand how the scope of the function works so that it can update a global counter. Function can reach outside of itself and get variable.
3) Control + D in VS Code to select multiple of same word is useful.
